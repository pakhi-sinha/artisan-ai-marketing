## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with the necessary APIs enabled.
* A GCP service account key (`.json` file) with appropriate permissions.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/pakhi-sinha/artisan-ai-marketing.git](https://github.com/pakhi-sinha/artisan-ai-marketing.git)
    cd artisan-ai-marketing
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Google Cloud Credentials:**

    **IMPORTANT:** Your service account `.json` key file is a secret and should never be committed to Git. The `.gitignore` file in this project is already configured to ignore `.json` files.

    Make your key file available to the application by setting an environment variable. Rename your key file to `service_account.json` and place it in the project's root directory. The application is coded to look for this specific file name.

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
